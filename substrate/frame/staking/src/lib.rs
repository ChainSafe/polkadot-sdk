//! # Staking Pallet
//!
//! The Staking pallet is used to manage funds at stake by network maintainers.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Staking pallet is the means by which a set of network maintainers (known as _authorities_ in
//! some contexts and _validators_ in others) are chosen based upon those who voluntarily place
//! funds under deposit. Under deposit, those funds are rewarded under normal operation but are held
//! at pain of _slash_ (expropriation) should the staked maintainer be found not to be discharging
//! its duties properly.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! - Staking: The process of locking up funds for some time, placing them at risk of slashing
//!   (loss) in order to become a rewarded maintainer of the network.
//! - Validating: The process of running a node to actively maintain the network, either by
//!   producing blocks or guaranteeing finality of the chain.
//! - Nominating: The process of placing staked funds behind one or more validators in order to
//!   share in any reward, and punishment, they take.
//! - Stash account: The account holding an owner's funds used for staking.
//! - Controller account (being deprecated): The account that controls an owner's funds for staking.
//! - Era: A (whole) number of sessions, which is the period that the validator set (and each
//!   validator's active nominator set) is recalculated and where rewards are paid out.
//! - Slash: The punishment of a staker by reducing its funds.
//!
//! ### Goals
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! The staking system in Substrate NPoS is designed to make the following possible:
//!
//! - Stake funds that are controlled by a cold wallet.
//! - Withdraw some, or deposit more, funds without interrupting the role of an entity.
//! - Switch between roles (nominator, validator, idle) with minimal overhead.
//!
//! ### Scenarios
//!
//! #### Staking
//!
//! Almost any interaction with the Staking pallet requires a process of _**bonding**_ (also known
//! as being a _staker_). To become *bonded*, a fund-holding register known as the _stash account_,
//! which holds some or all of the funds that become frozen in place as part of the staking process.
//! The controller account, which this pallet now assigns the stash account to, issues instructions
//! on how funds shall be used.
//!
//! An account can become a bonded stash account using the [`bond`](Call::bond) call.
//!
//! In the event stash accounts registered a unique controller account before the controller account
//! deprecation, they can update their associated controller back to the stash account using the
//! [`set_controller`](Call::set_controller) call.
//!
//! There are three possible roles that any staked account pair can be in: `Validator`, `Nominator`
//! and `Idle` (defined in [`StakerStatus`]). There are three corresponding instructions to change
//! between roles, namely: [`validate`](Call::validate), [`nominate`](Call::nominate), and
//! [`chill`](Call::chill).
//!
//! #### Validating
//!
//! A **validator** takes the role of either validating blocks or ensuring their finality,
//! maintaining the veracity of the network. A validator should avoid both any sort of malicious
//! misbehavior and going offline. Bonded accounts that state interest in being a validator do NOT
//! get immediately chosen as a validator. Instead, they are declared as a _candidate_ and they
//! _might_ get elected at the _next era_ as a validator. The result of the election is determined
//! by nominators and their votes.
//!
//! An account can become a validator candidate via the [`validate`](Call::validate) call.
//!
//! #### Nomination
//!
//! A **nominator** does not take any _direct_ role in maintaining the network, instead, it votes on
//! a set of validators to be elected. Once interest in nomination is stated by an account, it takes
//! effect at the next election round. The funds in the nominator's stash account indicate the
//! _weight_ of its vote. Both the rewards and any punishment that a validator earns are shared
//! between the validator and its nominators. This rule incentivizes the nominators to NOT vote for
//! the misbehaving/offline validators as much as possible, simply because the nominators will also
//! lose funds if they vote poorly.
//!
//! An account can become a nominator via the [`nominate`](Call::nominate) call.
//!
//! #### Voting
//!
//! Staking is closely related to elections; actual validators are chosen from among all potential
//! validators via election by the potential validators and nominators. To reduce use of the phrase
//! "potential validators and nominators", we often use the term **voters**, who are simply the
//! union of potential validators and nominators.
//!
//! #### Rewards and Slash
//!
//! The **reward and slashing** procedure is the core of the Staking pallet, attempting to _embrace
//! valid behavior_ while _punishing any misbehavior or lack of availability_.
//!
//! Rewards must be claimed for each era before it gets too old by
//! [`HistoryDepth`](`Config::HistoryDepth`) using the `payout_stakers` call. Any account can call
//! `payout_stakers`, which pays the reward to the validator as well as its nominators. Only
//! [`Config::MaxExposurePageSize`] nominator rewards can be claimed in a single call. When the
//! number of nominators exceeds [`Config::MaxExposurePageSize`], then the exposed nominators are
//! stored in multiple pages, with each page containing up to [`Config::MaxExposurePageSize`]
//! nominators. To pay out all nominators, `payout_stakers` must be called once for each available
//! page. Paging exists to limit the i/o cost to mutate storage for each nominator's account.
//!
//! Slashing can occur at any point in time, once misbehavior is reported. Once slashing is
//! determined, a value is deducted from the balance of the validator and all the nominators who
//! voted for this validator (values are deducted from the _stash_ account of the slashed entity).
//!
//! Slashing logic is further described in the documentation of the `slashing` pallet.
//!
//! Similar to slashing, rewards are also shared among a validator and its associated nominators.
//! Yet, the reward funds are not always transferred to the stash account and can be configured. See
//! [Reward Calculation](#reward-calculation) for more details.
//!
//! #### Chilling
//!
//! Finally, any of the roles above can choose to step back temporarily and just chill for a while.
//! This means that if they are a nominator, they will not be considered as voters anymore and if
//! they are validators, they will no longer be a candidate for the next election.
//!
//! An account can step back via the [`chill`](Call::chill) call.
//!
//! ### Session managing
//!
//! The pallet implement the trait `SessionManager`. Which is the only API to query new validator
//! set and allowing these validator set to be rewarded once their era is ended.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! The dispatchable functions of the Staking pallet enable the steps needed for entities to accept
//! and change their role, alongside some helper functions to get/set the metadata of the pallet.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! The Staking pallet contains many public storage items and (im)mutable functions.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Example: Rewarding a validator by id.
//!
//! ```
//! use pallet_staking::{self as staking};
//! use frame_support::traits::RewardsReporter;
//!
//! #[frame_support::pallet(dev_mode)]
//! pub mod pallet {
//!   use super::*;
//!   use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
//!   use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;
//!   # use frame_support::traits::RewardsReporter;
//!
//!   #[pallet::pallet]
//!   pub struct Pallet<T>(_);
//!
//!   #[pallet::config]
//!   pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + staking::Config {}
//!
//!   #[pallet::call]
//!   impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
//!         /// Reward a validator.
//!         #[pallet::weight(0)]
//!         pub fn reward_myself(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResult {
//!             let reported = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//!             <staking::Pallet<T>>::reward_by_ids(vec![(reported, 10)]);
//!             Ok(())
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! ### Era payout
//!
//! The era payout is computed using yearly inflation curve defined at [`Config::EraPayout`] as
//! such:
//!
//! ```nocompile
//! staker_payout = yearly_inflation(npos_token_staked / total_tokens) * total_tokens / era_per_year
//! ```
//! This payout is used to reward stakers as defined in next section
//!
//! ```nocompile
//! remaining_payout = max_yearly_inflation * total_tokens / era_per_year - staker_payout
//! ```
//!
//! Note, however, that it is possible to set a cap on the total `staker_payout` for the era through
//! the `MaxStakersRewards` storage type. The `era_payout` implementor must ensure that the
//! `max_payout = remaining_payout + (staker_payout * max_stakers_rewards)`. The excess payout that
//! is not allocated for stakers is the era remaining reward.
//!
//! The remaining reward is send to the configurable end-point [`Config::RewardRemainder`].
//!
//! ### Reward Calculation
//!
//! Validators and nominators are rewarded at the end of each era. The total reward of an era is
//! calculated using the era duration and the staking rate (the total amount of tokens staked by
//! nominators and validators, divided by the total token supply). It aims to incentivize toward a
//! defined staking rate. The full specification can be found
//! [here](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/Token%20Economics.html#inflation-model).
//!
//! Total reward is split among validators and their nominators depending on the number of points
//! they received during the era. Points are added to a validator using the method
//! [`frame_support::traits::RewardsReporter::reward_by_ids`] implemented by the [`Pallet`].
//!
//! [`Pallet`] implements [`pallet_authorship::EventHandler`] to add reward points to block producer
//! and block producer of referenced uncles.
//!
//! The validator and its nominator split their reward as following:
//!
//! The validator can declare an amount, named [`commission`](ValidatorPrefs::commission), that does
//! not get shared with the nominators at each reward payout through its [`ValidatorPrefs`]. This
//! value gets deducted from the total reward that is paid to the validator and its nominators. The
//! remaining portion is split pro rata among the validator and the nominators that nominated the
//! validator, proportional to the value staked behind the validator (_i.e._ dividing the
//! [`own`](Exposure::own) or [`others`](Exposure::others) by [`total`](Exposure::total) in
//! [`Exposure`]). Note that payouts are made in pages with each page capped at
//! [`Config::MaxExposurePageSize`] nominators. The distribution of nominators across pages may be
//! unsorted. The total commission is paid out proportionally across pages based on the total stake
//! of the page.
//!
//! All entities who receive a reward have the option to choose their reward destination through the
//! [`Payee`] storage item (see [`set_payee`](Call::set_payee)), to be one of the following:
//!
//! - Stash account, not increasing the staked value.
//! - Stash account, also increasing the staked value.
//! - Any other account, sent as free balance.
//!
//! ### Additional Fund Management Operations
//!
//! Any funds already placed into stash can be the target of the following operations:
//!
//! The controller account can free a portion (or all) of the funds using the
//! [`unbond`](Call::unbond) call. Note that the funds are not immediately accessible. Instead, a
//! duration denoted by [`Config::BondingDuration`] (in number of eras) must pass until the funds
//! can actually be removed. Once the `BondingDuration` is over, the
//! [`withdraw_unbonded`](Call::withdraw_unbonded) call can be used to actually withdraw the funds.
//!
//! Note that there is a limitation to the number of fund-chunks that can be scheduled to be
//! unlocked in the future via [`unbond`](Call::unbond). In case this maximum
//! (`MAX_UNLOCKING_CHUNKS`) is reached, the bonded account _must_ first wait until a successful
//! call to `withdraw_unbonded` to remove some of the chunks.
//!
//! ### Election Algorithm
//!
//! The current election algorithm is implemented based on Phragmén. The reference implementation
//! can be found [here](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/tree/master/NPoS).
//!
//! The election algorithm, aside from electing the validators with the most stake value and votes,
//! tries to divide the nominator votes among candidates in an equal manner. To further assure this,
//! an optional post-processing can be applied that iteratively normalizes the nominator staked
//! values until the total difference among votes of a particular nominator are less than a
//! threshold.
//!
//! ## GenesisConfig
//!
//! The Staking pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`]. The `GenesisConfig` is optional and allow
//! to set some initial stakers.
//!
//! ## Related Modules
//!
//! - [Balances](../pallet_balances/index.html): Used to manage values at stake.
//! - [Session](../pallet_session/index.html): Used to manage sessions. Also, a list of new
//!   validators is stored in the Session pallet's `Validators` at the end of each era.
